# NLP language classification, generation and translation models
This is a series of models for NLP (Natural Language Processing).

## Language classification
The objective of this project is to train a simple RNN to on words of different languages and to verify if it learned to identify the style of each language.

## Language generation
In this model we are training a simple RNN on a set of words of different languages for it to understand each one sequence patterns. After trained it's possible to generate words on each of the languages based on the learned patterns.

## Dataset
The data was obtained from arcticles in wikipedia on these different languages. 
The articles were cleaned before loading to the model.
All characters were converted to ASCII.
